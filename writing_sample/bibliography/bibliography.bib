It introduces the different foundations that underlie the various criteria and provides an overview of currently available formal criteria, which we selected on the basis of their popularity in empirical practice and/or proven effectiveness. The chapter successively reviews principal component analysis (PCA)-based methods and common factor analysis (CFA)-based methods to assess the number of common factors. To assess the number of factors underlying an empirical data set, the chapter suggests some strategies. It explains the finding in many studies that the Kaiser criterion clearly yields inaccurate indications of the number of PCs and common factors, mostly indicating too many factors. Minimum average partial (MAP) performances in indicating the number of major factors deteriorated when the unique variances increased, with no clear tendency to over- or underindicate the number of factors.},

Carroll's criterion and the quartimax criterion are briefly reviewed; the varimax criterion is outlined in detail and contrasted both logically and numerically with the quartimax criterion. It is shown that the normal varimax solution probably coincides closely to the application of the principle of simple structure. However, it is proposed that the ultimate criterion of a rotational procedure is factorial invariance, not simple structure-although the two notions appear to be highly related. The normal varimax criterion is shown to be a two-dimensional generalization of the classic Spearman case, i.e., it shows perfect factorial invariance for two pure clusters. An example is given of the invariance of a normal varimax solution for more than two factors. The oblique normal varimax criterion is stated. A computational outline for the orthogonal normal varimax is appended. {\textcopyright} 1958 Psychometric Society.},

These rotations optimize a certain criterion (e.g., varimax, oblimin), designed to measure the degree of simple structure of the pattern matrix. Simple structure can be considered optimal if a (usually large) number of pattern elements is exactly zero. In the present paper, a class of oblique rotation procedures is proposed to rotate a pattern matrix such that it optimally resembles a matrix which has an exact simple pattern. It is demonstrated that this method can recover relatively complex simple structures where other well-known simple structure rotation techniques fail. {\textcopyright} 1994 The Psychometric Society.},

We then analyzed the choices made by the researchers concerning factor model, retention criteria, rotation, interpretation of factors and other issues relevant to factor analysis. The results indicate that choices made by researchers have generally been poor and that reporting practices have not allowed for informed review, cumulation of results, or replicability. A comparison of results by time interval (1975?1979; 1980?1984) revealed minimal differences in choices made or the quality of reporting practices.

There are several decisions that must be made when using EFA, with one of the more important being choice of the rotation criterion. This selection can be arduous given the numerous rotation criteria available and the lack of research/literature that compares their function and utility. Historically, researchers have chosen rotation criteria based on whether or not factors are correlated and have failed to consider other important aspects of their data. This study reviews several rotation criteria, demonstrates how they may perform with different factor pattern structures, and highlights for researchers subtle but important differences between each rotation criterion. The choice of rotation criterion is critical to ensure researchers make informed decisions as to when different rotation criteria may or may not be appropriate. The results suggest that depending on the rotation criterion selected and the complexity of the factor pattern matrix, the interpretation of the interfactor correlations and factor pattern loadings can vary substantially. Implications and future directions are discussed.},

The equations involved appear to be capable only of iterative solution; for more than three or four factors the computations become extremely laborious but may be feasible for high-speed electronic equipment. Either orthogonal or oblique solutions may be achieved. For illustrations, the Johnson-Reynolds study of "flow" and "selection" factors and the Thurstone box problem are reanalyzed. The presence of factorially complex tests produces a type of hyperplanar fit which the investigator may desire to adjust by graphical rotations; the smaller the number of such tests, the closer the criterion comes to approximating simple structure. {\textcopyright} 1953 Psychometric Society.},
