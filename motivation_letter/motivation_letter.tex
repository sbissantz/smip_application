\section*{My Motivation to become a SMiP-Associate}
\bigskip
Dear members of the selection committee,
\smallskip

\onehalfspacing

\paragraph{Most published research is false!} John Ioannidis stated in 2005.
Meanwhile, luminaries like Brian Nosek suggest that one driving force towards
improving science could be a profound statistical (re-)education. SMiP fosters
this cultural transformation. The program stands right in the middle, providing
(a) a coherent research network, (b) a cognitively stimulating environment,
and, most importantly, the proficient staff to guide the next generation of
research aspirants. I want to be part of it. Why? Because I want to develop at
my own best. A structured Ph.D. program will help me to do so. For example,
SMiP's \enquote{foundations} will aid in developing essential soft and hard
skills for my scientific career, like proficiency in scientific writing and
in-depth know-how on quantitative methods. The \enquote{extensions} will put
the finishing touch on my methodological training. However, they will also
allow me to sharpen my profile, which I'll explain next.

		Metascience $\cdot$ Quantitative Methods $\cdot$ Computer Science

\vspace{-0.4cm}

\paragraph{Metascience}

Thinking outside the box has always been prior for me. So despite the main
scope of my schedule, like social psychology (emphasis: stereotypes, racism \&
discrimination) and empirical research methods (emphasis: multivariate analysis
methods), I attended additional courses in philosophy (emphasis: logic \&
philosophy of science). The cross-disciplinary toolkit now intertwines with my
doctoral studies on metascience. In October 2021, Prof. Dr. Eunike Wetzel
recruited me for her team in the DFG Priority Program META-REP *LINK*. I do
meta-research at her lab on the role of measurement in the replicability of
empirical findings. Next summer, for example, we will conduct a
cross-disciplinary, multisample replication project. Combining it with an
experiment on the influence of measurement on replicability and effect size
heterogeneity abstracts one of our three projects. My team member, Caroline
Boehm, told me that Prof. Dr. Beatrice Kuhlmann is also a vibrant meta
scientist. She might be interested in becoming my secondary supervisor.

\paragraph{Quantitative Methods}

As an undergraduate student, I became passionate about quantitative methods.
Besides introductory courses on data collection, descriptive statistics, and
multivariate analysis, I acquired advanced skills in self-studies. For example,
I trained myself in Bayesian Data Analysis and started lately with
probabilistic machine learning. My methodological skill set did pay off in 2020
during my research internship at the Center for (\textsc{zepf}). Dr. Inga
Wagner invited me to join her team, elucidating mode effects in comparative
studies (\textsc{vera}). Our efforts finally led to an article we could publish in the
European Journal of Psychology of Education in 2021. All offered SMiP courses
will support me going forward in my modeling. But as a committed Bayesian, I am
curious about working with Prof. Dr. Jeffrey N. Rouder. He might also be
interested in becoming my third supervisor.

\paragraph{Computer Science}

Developing computer skills have ever played an essential role in my life. Going
fully open-source switching to (fedora) Linux as an undergraduate is a good
example. Acquiring coding skills is another. As a research assistant at the
Centre of Educational Research (\textsc{zepf}), I started R programming. It
became the kickoff for developing \textit{elisr}.\enquote{Exploratory Likert
Scaling} is an R package for exploratory dimensional analysis in the social
sciences, recently published on CRAN. But starting my Ph.D., I wanted to go
further. I have lately put my hands on the probabilistic programming language,
Stan, to gain flexibility in statistical modeling. The goal is to employ it as
the go-to analysis tool throughout my Ph.D. As far as I know, SMiP does not yet
offer programming courses in Stan. But this could be a superb chance for
contribution. Feeding first-hand information into the network,  preparing a
Stan webinar, for example, might be a place for me to start. Besides, I am
fascinated with Git. Having back-and-forths about version control at SMiP can
foster open-science/code/source practices and might be a sound argument for
having me.
