# smip_application

Welcome to my repository! Glad you made it. The repository structure is simple.
I submitted three documents to SMiP written in TeX: 

1. Curriculum Vitae (`curriculum_vitae`),
2. Letter of Motivation (`motivation_letter`)
3. Writing sample (`writing_sample`)

The repository contains all the necessary code to reproduce these files. Within
the directory, you find the code to duplicate each particular file. Feel free
to clone the repository and contribute. Using `XeLaTeX`, you shouldn't run into
compiling issues. But if you face any problems, please let me know. Just open
an issue ([here](https://github.com/issues)) and report the problem. 

## Quick access

To save you some time, I linked the PDF versions and the TeX code:
